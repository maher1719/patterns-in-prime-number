Question: can you give some algbra problems?
Answer: Certainly! Here are several algebraic problems, each wrapped in <math>...</math> for clarity:

<math>
\boxed{
1 + x - 2x^2 = 0
}
</math>

---

<math>
\boxed{
3y + 4y^2 = 5y + y^2
}
</math>

---

<math>
\boxed{
2z - 3(2z - 5) = z + 1
}
</math>

---

<math>
\boxed{
a + b - a(a + b) = 0
}
</math>

---

<math>
\boxed{
c^2 + d^2 = (c-d)^2
}
</math>

---

<math>
\boxed{
e(f+1) = f(e+1)
}
</math>

Each of these equations represents a different algebraic problem. The solutions to each equation may involve various algebraic manipulations, such as factoring or using the quadratic formula.
