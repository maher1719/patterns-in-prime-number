Question: how to make the text output when it is math to be in two markup &lt;latex&gt;&lt;/latex&gt;?
Answer: To ensure that mathematical expressions within your text are rendered using LaTeX syntax for display on web pages, you need to use specific HTML tags. The correct way to do this involves utilizing `&lt;math>` and its corresponding `&lt;/math>` tags along with the `type="math"/` attribute in the `span` tag (or any other element that can contain inline content). However, since no such elements are provided by standard HTML for LaTeX rendering out-of-the-box, you would typically use custom CSS or JavaScript to transform these spans into actual LaTeX code.

Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide on how to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **HTML Structure with Custom Span Tags:**

You need to wrap your mathematical expressions in `span` tags that contain the `type="math"` attribute and the `style` attribute for inline rendering or use CSS for block rendering.

```html
<span class="latex-container" style="display:inline-block;">
    $E = mc^2$
</span>
```

For LaTeX output, you would need a custom span tag specifically designed to handle this:

```html
<span class="latex-latex">
    $\int \frac{dx}{x}$
</span>
```

### 2. **CSS or JavaScript for Rendering:**

You will likely want the mathematical expressions to be rendered using LaTeX syntax, which often involves converting HTML span tags containing LaTeX code into actual LaTeX output. This can be achieved through custom CSS and possibly some JavaScript for a more sophisticated rendering experience.

Here is an example of how you might set this up:

#### 2.1 **CSS for Inline Rendering:**

```css
/* Custom class to handle inline LaTeX */
.latex-container {
    white-space: pre-wrap;
}

.latex-latex {
    display: inline-block;
}
```

#### 2.2 **JavaScript for Block-Level Rendering:**

If you want to render larger mathematical expressions or equations as block-level elements, you can use JavaScript to transform the spans into actual LaTeX output.

```javascript
// Function to convert span with class "latex-latex" into LaTeX code and display it in a paragraph
function renderMathInline() {
    const latexSpan = document.querySelectorAll('.latex-latex');
    if (latexSpan.length === 0) return;

    latexSpan.forEach(span => {
        // Assuming that the actual rendered result of LaTeX will be placed inside this div
        const containerDiv = document.createElement('div');

        let tex = span.textContent.replace(/\$\$/g, '$'); // Remove all occurrences of double dollar signs which might be used for display equations
        tex = MathJax.tex2jax(tex); // Use MathJax library to render the LaTeX

        containerDiv.innerHTML = `<p>${tex}</p>`;
        span.parentNode.replaceWith(containerDiv);
    });
}

// Initialize MathJax if needed (assuming you have included MathJax in your project)
window.onload = function() {
    const mathJaxScript = document.createElement('script');
    mathJaxScript.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.18/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML';
    document.head.appendChild(mathJaxScript);

    // Optionally add an event listener to handle MathJax initialization
    const mathJaxLoading = document.createElement('div');
    mathJaxLoading.innerHTML = "Initializing MathJax...";
    document.body.appendChild(mathJaxLoading);
}
```

### 3. **Adding the Custom CSS and JavaScript:**

Make sure you have included both custom styles and scripts in your HTML file. You can do this by adding a `<style>` tag in the head section of your HTML file and a `<script>` tag to load MathJax or implement your own rendering logic.

#### Example `index.html` File:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Math Render</title>
    <!-- Custom CSS -->
    <style>
        .latex-container {
            white-space: pre-wrap;
        }
        .latex-latex {
            display: inline-block;
        }
    </style>
    <!-- Including MathJax -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.18/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Example usage of custom classes -->
    <span class="latex-latex">$\int \frac{dx}{x}$</span>

    <!-- Custom JavaScript for rendering equations as paragraphs -->
    <script>
        function renderMathInline() {
            const latexSpans = document.querySelectorAll('.latex-latex');
            if (latexSpans.length === 0) return;

            latexSpans.forEach(span => {
                let tex = span.textContent.replace(/\$\$/g, '$'); // Remove all occurrences of double dollar signs which might be used for display equations
                tex = MathJax.tex2jax(tex); // Use MathJax library to render the LaTeX

                const containerDiv = document.createElement('div');
                containerDiv.innerHTML = `<p>${tex}</p>`;
                span.parentNode.replaceWith(containerDiv);
            });
        }

        window.onload = function() {
            renderMathInline();
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. **Conclusion:**

By using custom CSS for inline rendering and JavaScript to handle more complex or block-level LaTeX rendering, you can ensure that your mathematical expressions are displayed in the desired format (LaTeX code). The provided solution ensures that the text is rendered correctly on web pages without requiring any external libraries that might not be available in all environments.
